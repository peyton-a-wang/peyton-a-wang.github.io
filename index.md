I'm a current SWE @ [Splunk][splunk], former SWE intern @ [E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley][etrade-ms], and [Wellesley College][wellesley] alum ('22). 

In my free time, you'll find me singing/recording with friends, solving NYT crossword/sudoku puzzles, taking walks around the neighborhood with my family, or watching videos on cute pets/food.

Learn more about me by checking out the rest of my website or connecting with me!
