# Hi there, I'm Peyton! 👋

I'm a current SWE @ [Splunk][splunk], former SWE intern @ [E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley][etrade-ms], and [Wellesley College][wellesley] alum ('22). Among my friends and family, I'm also known as the Designated IT, Fun-Sized Pey, and Most Likely to Burn Down the Kitchen from Microwaving Food.

When I'm not at work or asleep, you can find me:  
   
🎤 &nbsp; singing and recording with friends  
🧩 &nbsp; solving NYT crossword and sudoku puzzles  
💪 &nbsp; taking walks around the neighborhood with my family  
📱 &nbsp; watching videos in bed about cute pets and food  
👩🏻‍💻 &nbsp; procrastinating on chores by coding something random  

Feel free to learn more about me by checking out the rest of my website or connecting with me!
